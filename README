Generator to create some nifty admin scaffolds.

Add this to your environment.rb (see: http://railscasts.com/episodes/39-customize-field-error)
This will make sure the admin errors will show in correct styling.

  # Change the error from div to span
  ActionView::Base.field_error_proc = Proc.new do |html_tag, instance_tag|
    "<span class='fieldWithErrors'>#{html_tag}</span>"
  end
