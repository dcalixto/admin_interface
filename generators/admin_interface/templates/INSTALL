Add following routes to config/routes.rb

  map.admin 'admin', :controller => 'admin'
  map.namespace :admin do |admin|
    # Add the following after you've used the admin_scaffold generator
    # admin.resources :model, :collection => {:destroy_all => :delete}
  end

Change the app/controllers/admin_controller.rb to have a before filter
only allowing admins to access it.
