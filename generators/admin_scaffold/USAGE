Description:
    Similar to original Rails scaffold generator but for admin interface.
    Does NOT create model since you probably have it already.

    Scaffolds controller and views for use in your admin view. The resource is
    ready to use as a starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented
    application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

Examples:
    `./script/generate admin_scaffold post`
    `./script/generate admin_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate admin_scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
